This script will be meant to visualize the crypto market and how it is doing.
It will iterate through a list of all of the available cryptos, plot their
closes and then it will also take an average of all of the crypto markets and
plot that w.r.t. time to visualize the health of the market. Maybe it should
also look at variations, not sure yet.
