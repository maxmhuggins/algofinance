Documentation for algofinance
=============================
Introduction
------------
Background
^^^^^^^^^^
algofinance is a project inspired originally by Benoit B. Mendelbrot's *The (Mis)Behavior of Markets*. After reading this, I was convinced to dive deeper into market analysis. Governed by an obsessive personality I believed I could make something that was better than what others were doing in terms of their investments. Furthermore, after reading the book, I was given the impression that, while a mature field, economics lacks in large part some rigor that a student of physics is quite familiar with. As a complete outsider, I have no doubt I will be met with the truth; that being that I have completely misjudged the situation, there is no easy money to be made with a higher level of intellect, and that I'm destined to fall under similar boring investment schemes as most other people!

Anyways, I have digressed largely to an audience of none and my point being I'm interested in market analysis and want to continue in the foundation that the father of fractals has laid. So, if you're interested in following along or supporting me you can do so by reading the relevant literature and contributing to the project or donating to my cause. Regardless, I will continue typing away nonsense until something makes sense and it will be documented here.

General Scope of the Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The general scope of algofinance includes development for an algorithm trading bot, research regarding fractal financial analysis, and general market analysis. As of now, I'm mostly interested in cryptocurrency trading for several reasons. The primary being the support offered by the community for trading and the ability to trade small amounts of coin at a time with little to no fees.
